 We present participant distribution information below, alongside assigned pseudonyms inspired by renowned literary figures from diverse cultural and subcultural backgrounds across India, to avoid numeric identifiers while still using culturally-appropriate names as opposed to Western pseudonyms commonly used. By using culturally meaningful pseudonyms, we avoid performing cultural erasure while respecting their anonymity.
